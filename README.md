# Calculator
Created a sleek black UI design üñ•Ô∏è for a simple #calculator using Tkinter in #Python. The calculator has buttons for basic math operations, a clear button (C), and an equal button (=). The expression entered is displayed in the label, and the result appears when the equal button is clicked.
